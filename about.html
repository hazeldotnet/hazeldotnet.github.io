                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi, I'm Hazel. I'm a self-taught sysadmin and network technician.
                I've been working in IT since high school, and I'm currently a Cyber Security undergrad majoring in International Business.
                <br>
                <br>Hazel(dot)net, or just Hazelnet, was just a cute name for my home network that I came up with while messing with reverse proxies years ago, a portmanteau of Hazelnut and Network.
                <br>
                <br>A majority of my projects are simple scripting (Python, PowerShell) and automation, with a few attempts at real dev work (like this website). From time to time I create bespoke solutions for work, that I sadly cannot make public, but they mostly consist of relational databases and inventory management.
                <br>
                <br>I also build mechanical keyboards, and I design custom keyboards from time to time, so you may see some of those when I have the funds.
                <br>
                <br>This site is meant to be a sort of portfolio to keep track of my myriad projects that I constantly juggle. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or just want to chat, my links can be found <a href="index.html">here</a>.
